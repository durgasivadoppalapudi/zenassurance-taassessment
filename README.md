Part-1 : Execute directly on stackblitz. In the code there are some private methods so i created
a public version of those just for unit test purpose.

Part-2 : Syntax is correct. Received console log statement as Making API request... from it 
I understand that the test is correctly executing the code that makes the API request. 
 However, it seems that the response from the API is not being received correctly. Because of 
 this otheres scenaros are not passed.

Part-3: I sent a another zipfile with name 'code' please use that to execute part-3 tassk. I added 
individual files for each test case. However if we want can add all in one file with 1 descripe and 
multiple it statements.

Challenges with this assessment - most of the time will be spent on setting up an environment to develop the code for each task.
